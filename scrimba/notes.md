## Fundamentals

- ### White Space

  - White space is the empty space between the elements in yout user interface.
  - use **em** units to make design responsive.

- ### Alignment

  - Alignment in UI design is the process of ensuring that every element is positioned correctly in relation to other elements.
  - simplify the number of columns.
  - try to add equal white space in conteiners.

- ### Contrast

  - Contrast is defined as being in a 'strikingly' different state from something else.
  - Use WCAG 2.0 contrast guidelines (AA 4,5:1 - AAA 7:1).

- ### Scale

  - Just as with alignment, white space, contrast, and the other.fundamentals, the size of every UI element must be carefully considered.

- ### Typograph

  - Good typography requires the understanding of other fundamentals, along with a few specil considerations.
  - Font Choices.
  - Visual Hierarchy.
  - Font size.
  - Alignment.
  - Letter spacing & line height.
  - Font styles (weight, italics, etc).
  - Color & Contras.

- ### Color

  - The first UI design fundamental that shapes a user's experience is color
  - Green: wealth, nature, growth.
  - Black: luxury, sophistication, elegance.
  - Avoid colors that don't work well.

- ### Visual Hierarchy

  - Every element on a user interface has a level of importance. Some elements are more important than others. Visual hierarchy is how we establish this importance.
